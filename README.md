## How to Use This Theme
Jekyll uses themes in two ways: gem-based or regular method. The regular method has the theme files spread across multiple folders in the site source. This port of Paradigm Shift uses the regular method.

This means you can simply grab the zip file or clone this repository, run `bundle install` in the new directory and finally `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

You can now access your brand-new Jekyll site on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/][local].

Enjoy!

It's not too hard, we promise!
